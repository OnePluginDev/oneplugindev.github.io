Above are free to use datasets scraped from compass-ssb.tamu.edu. All data scraped was publicly accessible (and still is), so I do not take any ownership of these datasets or how you choose to use them. You can use them to build projects, train ML models, etc. There are two options available for download, the original (.raw) file, and a parsed version that helps reduce the size and is generally easier to work with.
